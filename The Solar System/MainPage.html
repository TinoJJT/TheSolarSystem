            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p> Welcome to my website about the Solar System. I will take you to a journey exploring the most important and interesting parts of the Solar System. Outside some terms that you can Google, you will require no prior knowledge, so buckle up and let’s go!</p>
            
            <h2>General</h2>
            <p>The Solar System is our home star system, where eight planets and billions of smaller bodies orbit our star, the Sun. Despite all of these, the Solar System is almost completely empty (99.99999999999999999996% empty), because of the humanly incomprehensible size, about 2 light years in diameter.  This size also is what makes it extremely hard for us to ever travel outside. Indeed, humans have never travelled further than the moon, which was a 3 day trip in one direction. Our furthest space probe, Voyager 1, has been travelling for past 40 years and yet has only reached a distance of 0.002 light years, one thousandth of the way out.</p>
            
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Somewhere in the Milky Way galaxy there was a gas cloud made out of former stars that had gone supernova floating around. Eventually this gas cloud started to contract due to gravity pulling it together, and about 4.5 billion years ago the Sun and many planets around it formed, all at approximately the same time. Most scientist believe that there used to be more planets in the Solar System, but many of them either collided with each other and combined, or got absorbed by the Sun. The specifics of those events are largely unknown and almost impossible to study.</p>
            
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>Due to its enormous mass, the Sun is at the center of the Solar System, and all other objects orbit it either directly or indirectly, and due to the laws of gravity, the further an object is orbiting the Sun, the slower the orbit. Because of events that happened during the formation of the Solar System, most of the Solar System orbits in the same direction. <br> 
            The next eight largest objects by mass in the Solar System are all planets, with the four outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune being much larger than the four inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Even smaller bodies such as asteroids, comets, plutoids and other dwarf planets can be found scattered all around, and many of these have highly elliptical (non-circular) orbits.</p>
            
            <h2>Location in the Milky Way</h2>
            <p>The Solar System itself is a small part of the Milky Way galaxy, orbiting the center of the galaxy 27 000 light years away, along with billions of star systems. It takes about 250 000 million years four the Solar System to complete one orbit around the galaxy, meaning we have completed about 18 orbits since the Solar System was formed. As mentioned before, due to the vast scale and emptiness of outer space, there is nothing else nearby. In fact the next nearest star, Proxima Centauri is four light years away.</p>
