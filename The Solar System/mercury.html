            <h2>The first planet from the Sun</h2>
            <p>The planet closest to the Sun, and also the smallest and the one with the most irregular temperature. Its orbit is peculiar in the way that its sidereal rotation period is two thirds of its year length. These two combined give an effective day length in Mercury of 176 Earth days. On top of this the orbit of Mercury of the Sun is relatively eccentric, giving Mercury very strange seasons, and extremely irregular surface temperature. </p>
            
            <h2>Surface</h2>
            <p>Like mentioned above, the surface temperature of Mercury varies a lot due to its weird orbital characteristics. All of the atmosphere has been blown away by the intense solar radiation, so there is nothing to hold the heat in during the night, which are by the way 88 Earth days long. After the long night the Sun rises and almost instantly raises the temperature by hundreds of degrees, frying everything. Other than that, the Mercurian surface is very plain, with some craters scattered around, giving a look very similar to our moon.</p>
            
            <h2>Physical characteristics</h2>
            <p>Like all of the four inner planets, Mercury is made if mostly metals (in astronomy all elements other than hydrogen and helium are considered metals), but Mercury is made out of especially heavy elements, giving Mercury the second highest density of all planets, Earth being slightly above, but that is only because Earths bigger size leads to higher compression. Like said before, Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System, and in fact there are two moons (Titan and Ganymede) that are bigger in diameter. But due to Mercuries much higher density, Mercury is has more mass than those two combined. Mercury is also one of the two planets that has no moons of its own.</p>
